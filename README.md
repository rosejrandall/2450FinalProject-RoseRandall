My system will be for a nail salon and will assist with bookings and payments. It will allow clients to book appointments and make payments as well as allow nail technicians to keep a schedule and log of their clients. The system will be made for nail salons and is intended to be used by any potential client. The value this system offers is taking any booking work off of the nail technicians’ hands as well as making it easier for them to keep a clear and organized schedule. It also benefits clients by having one place to view what services are offered, who they can book with, and when they can book.
