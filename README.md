My system is a nail salon booking system that is intended to digitize booking and scheduling in salons. It allows clients to book appointments, view appointments and cancel appointments. Technicians can view, add, and remove from a schedule.

To run the system you can simply run main.py. It will create the text storage files if they are not copied over, but the current text files have clients and technicians that are helpful for using the system and already have appointments made.

Some usage examples are available in screenshots in the pdf from the docs directory, but the system is fairly self explanitory and offers examples of clients and technicians throughout the use. In addition, all uses can be made up by the user.
